  earlDescription: "The ancestry of King Duncan is not certain. In modern texts he
    is the son of Cr\xEDn\xE1n, hereditary lay abbot of Dunkeld, and Beth\xF3c, daughter
    of King Malcolm II. However, in the late 17th century the historian Frederic
    Van Bossen, after collecting historical accounts throughout Europe, identified
    King Duncan as the first son of Abonarhl ap crinan (the grandson of Crinan) and
    Princess Beatrice, the eldest daughter to King Malcom, the 2nd, and Gunora who
    was the daughter of the \"2nd Duke of Normandy\".\r\n\r\nUnlike the \"King Duncan\"
    of Shakespeare's Macbeth, the historical Duncan appears to have been a young
    man. He followed his grandfather Malcolm as king after the latter's death on
    25 November 1034, without apparent opposition. He may have been Malcolm's acknowledged
    successor or T\xE0naiste as the succession appears to have been uneventful. Earlier
    histories, following John of Fordun, supposed that Duncan had been king of Strathclyde
    in his grandfather's lifetime, between 1018 and 1034, ruling the former Kingdom
    of Strathclyde as an appanage. Modern historians discount this idea."
