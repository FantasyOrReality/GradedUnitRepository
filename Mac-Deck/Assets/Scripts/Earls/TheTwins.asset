  earlDescription: 'Brusi Sigurdsson (died between 1030 and 1035) was one of Sigurd
    Hlodvirsson''s four sons (together with Thorfinn, Einar and Sumarlidi ). He was
    joint Earl of Orkney from 1014. His life is recorded in the Orkneyinga Saga.


    The
    Orkneyinga Saga reports that when their father Earl Sigurd was killed at the
    Battle of Clontarf in 1014, the Norse earldom was divided between his three oldest
    sons, Brusi, Sumarlidi, and Einar "Wry-Mouth". The youngest son Thorfinn was
    only five years old and being fostered by his maternal grandfather Malcolm II
    of Scotland on the Scottish mainland who gave him the earldom of Caithness, which
    Sigurd had held from the Scottish crown. Brusi is described as "gentle, restrained,
    unassuming and a fine speaker". Sumarlidi was the oldest of the brothers and
    had a similar disposition to Brusi. Einar, on the other hand was "ruthless and
    grasping, a hard and successful fighting man".'
