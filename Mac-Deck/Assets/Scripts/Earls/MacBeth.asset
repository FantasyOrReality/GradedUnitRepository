  earlDescription: "Little is known about Macbeth's early life, although he was the
    son of Findl\xE1ech of Moray and may have been a grandson of Malcolm II. He became
    Mormaer of Moray \u2013 a semi-autonomous province \u2013 in 1032, and was probably
    responsible for the death of the previous mormaer, Gille Coemg\xE1in. He subsequently
    married Gille Coemg\xE1in's widow, Gruoch, but they had no children together.\r\n\r\nIn
    1040, Duncan I launched an attack into Moray and was killed in action by Macbeth's
    troops. Macbeth succeeded him as King of Alba, apparently with little opposition.
    His 17-year reign was mostly peaceful, although in 1054 he was faced with an
    English invasion, led by Siward, Earl of Northumbria, on behalf of Edward the
    Confessor. Macbeth was killed at the Battle of Lumphanan in 1057 by forces loyal
    to the future Malcolm III. He was buried on Iona, the traditional resting place
    of Scottish kings. "
