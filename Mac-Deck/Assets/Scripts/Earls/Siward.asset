  earlDescription: " It is possible Siward may have been of Scandinavian or Anglo-Scandinavian
    origin, perhaps a relative of Earl Ulf, although this is speculative and unclear.
    He emerged as a powerful regional strongman in England during the reign of Cnut
    (\"Canute the Great\", 1016\u20131035). Cnut was a Scandinavian ruler who conquered
    England in the 1010s, and Siward was one of the many Scandinavians who came to
    England in the aftermath of that conquest. Siward subsequently rose to become
    sub-ruler of most of northern England. From 1033 at the latest Siward was in
    control of southern Northumbria, that is, present-day Yorkshire, governing as
    earl on Cnut's behalf.\r\n\r\nHe entrenched his position in northern England
    by marrying \xC6lffl\xE6d, the daughter of Ealdred, Earl of Bamburgh. After killing
    Ealdred's successor Eadulf in 1041, Siward gained control of all Northumbria.
    He exerted his power in support of Cnut's successors, kings Harthacnut and Edward,
    assisting them with vital military aid and counsel. He probably gained control
    of the middle shires of Northampton and Huntingdon by the 1050s, and there is
    some evidence that he spread Northumbrian control into Cumberland. In the early
    1050s Earl Siward turned against the Scottish king Mac Bethad mac Findla\xEDch
    (\"Macbeth\"). Despite the death of his son Osbjorn, Siward defeated Mac Bethad
    in battle in 1054. More than half a millennium later the adventure in Scotland
    earned him a place in William Shakespeare's Macbeth. Siward died in 1055, leaving
    one son, Waltheof, who would eventually succeed to Northumbria. St Olave's church
    in York and nearby Heslington Hill are associated with Siward. "
